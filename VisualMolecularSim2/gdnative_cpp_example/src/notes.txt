roughly: derivative of potential energy is force

three body problem: sometimes no general solution exists so diffEq isnt good always. do rungekutta4.



RUNGA KUTTA 4: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods :
it is: y_{n+1} is the next position of the simulation. h is the timestep since they are adding t_n + h to get t_{n+1}

def velocity(t, [x,y]):
    return [t, -t] # Shows it going down faster and faster to bottom right. (for this example)

pos = [0, 0]
time = 0
while true:
      delta = ? (get delta time)
      k1=velocity (time, pos)
      k2 = velocity(time + delta/2, pos+delta * k1/2)
      k3=velocity(time + delta / 2, pos+delta*k2/2)
      k4=velocity(time+delta,pos+delta*k3)
      pos+=1/6*(k1+2*k2+2*k3+k4)*delta
      time+=delta






m times integral of f dot dr = E
